## Your Mission

Create a form in react that will validate before it allows it to be submitted.
You won't actually be submitting the information through, just validating it and sending the user to a new page once all of the fields have been filled in successfully. All fields can be considered required for this exercise.

The fields and their validation strategies are as follows:
- Name - Cannot be blank
- Email - Must be a valid email
- Username - Cannot be blank
- Password - Cannot be blank
- Confirm password - Must match the password
- Website - Must be a valid url

You can use whatever validation method you prefer. Example below:
